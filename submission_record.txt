** You have the following failures in Task 1: Tokenize, scoring: 0%
- Splits on spaces.
- Splits on any whitespace.
- Converts to lower case.
- Splits on all non-letters [numbers, punctuations, etc].
- Drops terms with length smaller than 2.


** You have the following failures in Task 2: FirstLayer, scoring: 0%
- tf.contrib.layers.batch_norm was not added.
- Embedding should have no bias term.
- Input normalization.
- You are regularizing entire embedding matrix! This will drop embeddings of infrequent words to zero :(
- L2 regularization on the output is incorrect.
- Proper layer with tanh activation.


** You have the following failures in Task 3: SparseDropout, scoring: 0%
- Not Implemented.


** You have the following failures in Task 4: EMBEDDING_VAR Tracking, scoring: 0%
- You are not setting EMBEDDING_VAR in BuildInferenceNetwork
